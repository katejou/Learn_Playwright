 If one of the tests fails, all subsequent tests are skipped. All tests in the group are retried together.

When running with retries, all tests are retried together:

Worker process #1:
    beforeAll hook runs
    first good passes
    second flaky fails
    third good is skipped
Worker process #2:
    beforeAll hook runs again
    first good passes again
    second flaky passes
    third good passes
