[more] commands than we already talked about.

line = show sentence
dot = if test pass show '.', if fail show a 'F'
html = >  npx playwright show-report

check playwright.config.ts > defineConfig > reporter 
https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters
// when I set up like this in config:
 reporter: [
    ['list', { printSteps: true }],
    ['json', {  outputFile: 'test-results.json' }],
    ['html', { open: 'always', outputFolder: 'my-report' }]
  ],

// and execute > npx playwright test   // without any specific reporter
// 1. the cmd will list out sentences
// 2. the html will open, and the file will save at /my-report
// 3. test-results.json will be appears
